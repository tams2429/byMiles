## Overview 👓

A simple, **web application** that takes **returns information** about the **user's insurance policy** once **logged in**.

The **API** which contains the **insurance policy information** has been **provided** to help with the task. The **technical stack** has **not been specified** and I was free to choose what I am most comfortable in.

In total the task took around ....hrs/days. Though most of this was attributed to learning more and applying certain testing technniques which were new to me.

## Technologies 💻

- General:
    - **HTML5**
    - **CSS3**
    - **React**
- Others:
    - **GitHub**
- 3rd party packages:
    - **Axios**


## Process 📝
- I started by **testing** how to use the **provided API** using a tool called **Insomnia**, and seeing **how the request is sent** and **what data is returned** in the **response**.

- I then decided on the **tech. stack** I was going to use for this challenge. This was based on my **experience** which was focused on **React (Front-End)**.

- Next, I started on building the **Front-End components** (i.e. the **'Sign In' form**, the **'Policy' page**). The **initial design** was based on the **provided wireframe**.

- After completing the Front-End components, I moved on to **setting up** the **API requests** and **handling** and **presenting** the **response data**.

- Throughout this process, I had set up a number of tests, though not exhaustive due to my inexperience with testing (i.e. unit testing)

### MVP
- **GitHub repository** containing project code
- **Readme document** containing **thought processes** and **any assumptions made**
- **Estimation of time** spent
- A **simple**, **web application** which takes a **'username' and 'password'**, upon **successful log in**, **'insurance policy' information** is **returned** and **presented** to the **user** on the application

## Getting Started 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️

If you wish to **run it locally**, you will need to **follow the steps below**:

- **Fork** or **Clone** the GitHub repository ([https://github.com/tams2429/byMiles](https://github.com/tams2429/byMiles)),
- In the root project folder, run `npm install` to **install** all **dependencies**,
- `npm start` to **start the development server** for the **whole application**,
